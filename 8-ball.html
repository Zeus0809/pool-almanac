			<h2>The Rules: 8-ball</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="introduction">Welcome to my guide on the rules of 8-ball pool, one of the most popular cue sports games in the world. Originally played in the early 1900s, 8-ball pool has become a staple of pool halls, bars, and homes everywhere, enjoyed by casual players and professionals alike.</p>
		<div class="heading-flex">
			<h3>How to play?</h3>
			<img src="multimedia/pics/solids-stripes-8.jpg" alt="Ball set for 8-ball, solids and stripes">
		</div>
		<p>The objective of 8-ball pool is to use your cue stick to pocket all of your designated balls (either <dfn>solids</dfn> or <dfn>stripes</dfn>) and then sink the 8-ball to win the game. Sounds simple enough, but there are a number of specific rules and strategies to keep in mind when playing this game.</p>
		<p class="list-heading">Here is the list of additional considerations when playing 8-ball according to <strong><a href="https://www.playcsipool.com/" target="newtab"><abbr>CSI</abbr> (Cue Sports International):</a></strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>At the beginning of the game, the balls are arranged in a triangular rack and the cue ball is placed behind the <a href="8-ball.html#references" class="reference">head string [1]</a> for the break shot.</li>
			<li>If a ball is pocketed on the break, it does not assign ball groups to the players. A player needs to pocket a stripe or a solid in order to choose their group. However, making one or more balls on the break lets the player continue their turn. </li>
			<li>If a player pockets their designated group of balls and then pockets the 8 ball on the same shot, they lose the game.</li>
			<li>If the 8 ball is pocketed prematurely (before the player has pocketed their group of balls), the player loses the game.</li>
			<li>If the 8 ball is not pocketed on the break, it remains in play as a live ball.</li>
		</ol>
		<div id="break">
			<h3>Break</h3>
			<div id="break-flex">
				<p>Breaking the rack is an important part of pool: on the professional level, a nice break shot is often the key to winning a game. A legal break shot in 8-ball is done by placing the cue ball anywhere behind the head string and hitting the rack in a way that at least 4 balls from it touch the rail. <span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip:</span> most good players break the rack of 8-ball from the middle of the kitchen line or a few inches to the side of it. Breaking from that area lets the cue ball transfer all of its impulse to the balls making them spread nicer and raising the chance of pocketing a ball.</p>

		</div>
		<div id="fouls">
			<h3>Fouls</h3>
			<p class="list-heading">Every game in pool has the concept of <dfn>foul</dfn>, or an illegal shot. There is always a penalty charged to the player who fouled, and the opponent gets some kind of advantage. Let’s look at all possible foul cases in 8-ball:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="foul-flex">
					<p>Just like in most games of pool, pocketing the cue ball is a foul (it’s called a <dfn>scratch</dfn>). The opponent gets <dfn><q>ball in hand</q></dfn> and places the cue ball <a href="8-ball.html#references" class="reference">anywhere on the table [2]</a> for their next shot.</p>
					<img src="multimedia/gifs/scratch.gif" alt="Scratch demo, GIF file">
				</li>
				<li class="foul-flex">
					<p>Another type of foul is hitting a wrong ball with the cue ball. When stripes and solids are picked by players, the player who chose solids can only hit balls 1-7 first, and the other player can only do 9-15. Hitting your opponent’s ball or the 8 ball is a foul – player gets ball in hand. </p>
					<img src="multimedia/gifs/8_wrong_ball_foul.gif" alt="Demo of a wrong ball foul in 8-ball, GIF file">
				</li>
				<li class="foul-flex">
					<p>If a player touches <a href="8-ball.html#references" class="reference">any ball on the table [3]</a> with their cue stick, hand, apparel, or any object other than the cue tip, it is ball in hand for the opponent.</p>
					<img src="multimedia/gifs/touch_foul.gif" alt="Demo of a foul by touching other balls, GIF file">
				</li>
				<li class="foul-flex">
					<p>If any ball flies off the table, it is ball in hand. Any object ball driven off the table stays in the pocket and doesn’t get <a href="8-ball.html#references" class="reference">spotted [4]</a>.</p>
					<img src="multimedia/gifs/fly_off_foul.gif" alt="Demo of a foul by driving a ball off the table, GIF file">
				</li>
				<li class="foul-flex">
					<p>No rail after the shot. If none of the balls touches at least one rail after the contact, and nothing is pocketed, the shot is considered illegal. Ball in hand.</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="flukes">
			<h3>Flukes</h3>
			<p>Another thing to keep in mind is accidentally pocketed balls, or <dfn>flukes</dfn>. In 8-ball, any fluked ball stays in the pocket, but does not give the player an opportunity to continue the turn. Players have to make their intention clear as for what ball into what pocket they are trying to make. In other words, 8-ball is a <dfn>call shot</dfn> game. Remember that pocketing the 8 while your balls are still on the table is a loss, so make sure you don’t fluke it!</p>
		</div>
		<div id="safety">
			<h3>Safety</h3>
			<p>All possible shots in pool games can be divided into 2 categories: <dfn>offensive</dfn> and <dfn>defensive</dfn> shots. It is important to know when and how to use both in order to win more games. Defensive shots are usually called <dfn>safeties</dfn> or <dfn>playing safe</dfn>. If a player decides to play safe, they don’t <a href="8-ball.html#references" class="reference">go for a pot [5]</a>, but rather try to put the cue ball in an awkward or uncomfortable position for their opponent.</p>
			<p>8-ball has a special safety rule. At any time during the game, you have an option to call <q>defense</q> and make one of your balls. In this case the turn will go back to your opponent, and the pocketed ball will stay in the pocket. <span class="pro-tip">Pro Tip:</span> think how you can use this tool to benefit from a bad position.</p>
			<p class="note"><span class="pro-tip">Racking tip:</span> When racking 8-ball, it is considered good practice to alternate solids and stripes instead of putting them next to each other. That way the balls are more likely to spread evenly after the break and not leave any player with a better layout.</p>

			<h3>References</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><dfn>Head string</dfn> (sometimes referred to as kitchen line) is the line running across the pool table from the second diamond on one long rail to the second diamond on the other long rail. This line separates the so-called <q>kitchen area</q> from the rest of the table.</li>
				<li>There is an exception to this: if the cue ball is pocketed on the break, the incoming player can put the ball anywhere behind the head string.</li>
				<li>Different tournaments may have 2 variations of this rule: it is either <q>all ball fouls</q> (when ball in hand is given for any illegal touch), or <q>cue ball fouls</q> (when ball in hand is only given in case of touching the cue ball on accident).</li>
				<li>To spot a ball means to take it out of a pocket and put it on the <dfn>spot</dfn> (the middle mark on a pool table located where the second diamond lines cross)</li>
				<li><dfn>Pot</dfn> – a short term for making or pocketing a ball. The act of making a ball is referred to as pot.</li>
